# NovaMint

**A Revolutionary Creator Monetization Platform on Somnia Testnet**

NovaMint is a cutting-edge decentralized platform that empowers creators to monetize their digital content through NFTs with built-in royalty distribution. Built on the Somnia Testnet blockchain, our platform revolutionizes how creators earn from their work by providing a seamless, transparent, and fair monetization system.

## What NovaMint Does

###  **Audio Content Monetization**
Creators can upload their music, podcasts, sound effects, or any audio content and mint them as NFTs. Each audio NFT represents true ownership of the digital asset, allowing creators to sell their work directly to fans and collectors.

###  **Digital Art Marketplace**
Artists can showcase and sell their digital artwork as NFTs. From illustrations to digital paintings, creators can establish their presence in the digital art world while maintaining full ownership and control over their creations.

###  **Automatic Royalty Distribution**
Our smart contract system automatically distributes earnings with a transparent 90/10 split:
- **90%** goes directly to the creator
- **10%** supports platform development and maintenance

###  **True Ownership & Transparency**
Every NFT is stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) ensuring permanent, decentralized storage. The blockchain provides immutable proof of ownership and transaction history.

###  **Creator Economy Revolution**
NovaMint breaks down traditional barriers in the creator economy by:
- Eliminating intermediaries
- Providing instant, transparent payments
- Ensuring creators retain control over their content
- Creating new revenue streams for digital creators
