**Creator Monetization Platform on Hedera Network**

NovaMint is a platform that helps digital creators earn money from their work. Whether you create music, art, or other digital content, NovaMint lets you sell your creations directly to fans and collectors while keeping most of the money you earn.

## What NovaMint Does

### Audio Content Monetization
Musicians, podcasters, and audio creators can upload their work and sell it as digital collectibles. Each piece of audio becomes a unique digital item that fans can buy and own. This gives creators a new way to earn money from their music and audio content.

### Digital Art Marketplace
Artists can showcase and sell their digital artwork. This includes digital paintings, illustrations, and any visual art created on computers. Artists maintain full control over their work and can set their own prices.

### Automatic Royalty Distribution
When someone buys your content, the money is automatically split:
- 90% goes directly to you, the creator
- 10% goes to the platform for maintenance and development

### True Ownership and Transparency
Your content is stored on a decentralized network called IPFS, which means it can't be deleted or lost. Every sale and transaction is recorded on the blockchain, creating a permanent record of who owns what.

### Breaking Down Barriers
NovaMint removes the middlemen that typically take large cuts from creators' earnings. Instead of going through record labels, galleries, or streaming platforms, creators can sell directly to their audience and keep most of the money.

## Technical Details

### What is an NFT?
An NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is like a digital certificate of ownership. It proves that you own a specific piece of digital content. Unlike regular files that can be copied, an NFT is unique and can't be duplicated.

### What is Hedera Network?
Hedera is a blockchain network that's fast, cheap to use, and environmentally friendly. It uses HBAR as its currency, which is much cheaper to use than other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

### What is IPFS?
IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a way to store files across many computers instead of on one server. This means your content can't be deleted or lost, even if one computer goes offline.

### Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are computer programs that automatically handle transactions. When someone buys your content, the smart contract automatically sends you 90% of the money and keeps 10% for the platform.
